## Known Issues

- Client and server (mostly server) is sometimes failing to launch. If that happen just try launching again server/client.
- There is still (sometimes) game freezes about 1-3 seconds. (It looks like the cause is Weather2-Remastered, specifically the storm formation algorythm (at least on server side, on client idk))
